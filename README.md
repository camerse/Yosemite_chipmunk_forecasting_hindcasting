# Yosemite_chipmunk_forecasting_hindcasting
Figures from published project includes pdf to full article

Published project that uses machine learning to predict presence/absence of three chipmunk species in Yosemite national park

Current and historical datasets were used to parameterize models and develop forecast/hindcast predictions
Uses True Skills Statistic and AUROC to evaluate model performance

Algorithm implemented is Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) from r package 'mda'

3.jpg Probability of presence, forecasting and hindcasting; includes AUROC and TSS scores

4.jpg MARS predicted probability of presence for two species, across minimum monthly temperatures (MinT) in historical (black circles), and modern (open circles) models. MARS probabilities generated from historical and modern single-species climate-only models.
